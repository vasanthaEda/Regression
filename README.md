# Regression

Objective:

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression analysis using Python. The analysis predicts 
the number of medals won by teams based on the number of athletes and previous medals won. 



Project Structure: 

• `Linear_Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the linear regression 
analysis. 
• `teams.csv`: CSV file with the data used for the analysis.



Usage: 

1. Ensure all the required libraries are installed. You can install them using the `requirements.txt` 
file. 
2. Run the `Linear_Regression.ipynb` notebook to see the analysis.
